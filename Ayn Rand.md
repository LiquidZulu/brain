**Alice O'Connor** (born **Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum**; February 2 \[[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") January 20], [[1905]] – March 6, [[1982]]), better known by her pen name **Ayn Rand** (/aɪn/), was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism]]. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays, she achieved fame with her [[1943]] novel, *[[FH|The Fountainhead]]*. In [[1957]], Rand published her best-selling work, the novel *[[AS|Atlas Shrugged]]*. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.
